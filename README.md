# SolidPrinciples-DependencyInjection
 This project includes examples of Solid principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle and Dependency Inversion Principle) and dependency injection.
 These examples are written in C++.
## Solid Principles
Solid principles are some of the most important principles used in software design. These principles help to develop quality software by increasing factors such as code readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

This project covers five Solid principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one responsibility.

- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be closed to changes but open to extensions.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses must be usable in place of superclasses.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: The client should not have to implement an interface that it does not need.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Dependencies between classes must be managed through abstraction.

Each Solid principle is explained with sample codes. In addition, explanations of how the principle is applied are included in each example.

## Dependency Injection
Dependency injection is a software design pattern that enables an object or class to use the dependencies of another object or class. This pattern allows classes to become more flexible by injecting their dependencies from outside rather than being part of their dependencies.
This project contains sample codes for the dependency injection principle. These examples show how a class or object can get dependencies of another class or object.

## How to use?
Each example file is a C++ program and demonstrates its own use of Solid principle or dependency injection. Each sample file is designed to be compilable and executable on its own.

To run the examples, a C++ compiler must first be installed. You can then follow the steps below to compile and run the sample file:

1-Clone or download this project.

2-Go to the directory where the sample file is.

3-Use the following command to compile the sample file: g++ -o example example.cpp

4-If the compilation is successful, you can run the sample file with the following command: ./example
