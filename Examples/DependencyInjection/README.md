# Dependency-Injection-Example
This example shows how the Dependency Injection principle can be used.

## How does it work?
This program creates an instance of the Client class using the Service class that implements the IService interface. The Client class uses the IService interface and uses the Service class as a dependency here.

With Dependency Injection, the Service object is passed to the constructor of the Client object, so the Client object can use the Service object. This makes the Client class less complex and more flexible.
