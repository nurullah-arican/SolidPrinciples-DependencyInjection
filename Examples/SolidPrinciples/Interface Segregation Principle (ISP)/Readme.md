# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The ISP principle requires that an interface not contain unused methods, and that a class should create a dependency with an interface that contains only the methods it uses. This principle ensures that a class uses only the ones it needs, rather than using too many methods unnecessarily. Thus, when a class's interface changes, there are fewer dependencies that only related classes will be affected.
